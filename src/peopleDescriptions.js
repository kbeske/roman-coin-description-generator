  {label: 'Domitian (81–96 ce)', value: 'Titus Flavius Domitianus, better known as Domitian, was born in 51 AD to Vespasian and Flavia Domitilla. His father became emperor during a civil war in 69.  With his father in power, Domitian was granted the title of caesar and became praetor the following year.  His older brother, Titus Flavius Vespasianus, was next in line to become emperor, but as he did not have a son, it was widely believed that Domitian would succeed him.  When Vespasian died and Titus Flavius Vespasianus became Emperor, Domitian expected to move into his brother’s old position, but received no such power, which caused a rift between the brothers.  Titus Flavius Vespasianus died in 81 after a short 2 year rule, and Domitian became Emperor.  As a ruler, he was competent but severe.  Aristocrats and government officials hated him, but he was very popular with the army, likely because he raised their pay in 84.  Some of his eccentricities offended people, such as wanting to be addressed as dominus et deus (“master and god”).  After he ordered the execution of a few of his cousins, his supporters worried that they weren’t safe and conspired to kill him.  They succeeded on September 18, 96.'},
  {label: 'Nerva (96–98 ce)', value: 'Marcus Cocceius Nerva, more commonly known as simply Nerva, was born just north of Rome in either 30 or 35 AD.  His family was fairly politically powerful, with ancestors on his father’s side (all also named Marcus Cocceius Nerva) associating with imperial figures since Augustus’s reign.  Nerva became an advisor to Emperor Nero and helped expose the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero in 65.  During this time he became friends with Vespasian, who became emperor following Nero’s suicide and the tumultuous Year of the Four Emperors (Galba, Otho, Vitellus, and finally Vespasian).  Vespasian made Nerva a consul, as did his son Domitian when he acceded the throne.  Domitian was assassinated in 96, and the Senate proclaimed Nerva emperor that same day.  It’s unclear whether Nerva was aware of the assassination plot.  This was the first time the Senate chose an emperor; previous emperors had been recognized by the Senate after being chosen by their predecessor, the army, or the Praetorian Guard.  Some believed Nerva was a strange choice for emperor because, by emperor standards, he was old - in his 60s - and childless.  However, others believed he was a safe choice for the Senate for the same reasons.  Nerva quickly accepted the Senate’s nomination, wanting to avoid anything like the chaos that followed Nero’s death, and set to ingratiating himself with people Domitian had oppressed.  Most notably, he introduced many reforms focused on easing taxes for poorer Romans.  In 97, after briefly being taken hostage by the Praetorian Guard, Nerva saw that his authority was slipping and named Trajan his successor.  A few months later, at the start of 98, Nerva died of fever.  He is now known as one of the Five Good Emperors, the others being Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.'},

  {label: 'Trajan (98–117 ce)', value: 'Marcus Ulpius Traianus, commonly called Trajan, is known as one of the Five Good Emperors (the others are Nerva, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius).  He was born in present-day Seville, Spain in 53 AD.  He distinguished himself both in the military and as a governor during Domitian’s rule, and then was chosen by Nerva to be heir to the throne.  Upon his accession in 98, Trajan gave money to plebian Romans.  He also formalized alimenta, a welfare program that helped disadvantaged children in Italy, and organized the construction of buildings, bridges, roads, and more.  He incorporated many new territories into the empire, so much so that by his death by sickness in 117, the empire was at its maximum territorial extent.  One of these new territories was Roman Dacia, which Romanians view as the beginnings of present-day Romania.  Trajan, by extension, is seen as one of the founders of Romania and is a key figure in Romanian culture.'},
  {label: 'Sabina', value: 'Vibia Sabina, often simply called Sabina, was a Roman Empress and wife of Hadrian.  She was born in 83 AD in Rome.  Her father died the following year, prompting Sabina and her half-sister to live with their grandmother, Marciana, Trajan’s sister.  Sabina married Hadrian in 100.  Hadrian succeeded Trajan as emperor in 117, but Sabina wasn’t awarded the title of Augusta until 128.  Some sources say Hadrian treated her poorly, but others say he respected her immensely.  Sabina is the first woman whose image was featured on a continuous series of coins minted in Rome.  She also traveled more than any empress before her, garnering more public honors in Rome and the provinces than any empress since Livia, the wife of Augustus.  She died in 136 or early 137.'},
  {label: 'Faustina the Elder', value: 'Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder, sometimes called Faustina I, Faustina Sr., or Faustina Major, was born circa 100 AD in Rome.  She was the daughter of Marcus Annius Verus and Rupilia Faustina.  Sometime between 110 and 115, she married Antoninus Pius.  When her uncle, then-emperor Hadrian, died in 138, Faustina’s husband acceded the throne according to Hadrian’s wishes and Faustina became empress.  She worked with charities and enabled Roman children, especially girls, to receive education.  Faustina had a personal style that became popular - particularly her unique braided hairstyle, which was emulated for a few generations after her.  She died in 140, to Antoninus Pius’s devastation.  He constructed and dedicated a temple to her in the Roman Forum, making Faustina the first empress with a permanent presence there.  He also established the Puellae Faustinianae (Girls of Faustina) charity that provided help for orphaned Roman girls.  Faustina and Antoninus were thought to be paragons of a happy marriage, so much so that newlyweds were advised to pray to them.'},
  {label: 'Faustina the Younger', value: 'Annia Galeria Faustina, also known as Faustina the Younger, Faustina Jr., or Faustina Minor, was born around 130 AD to Roman emperor Antoninus Pius and Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder.  After her marriage to Marcus Aurelius in 145 and the birth of their first child in 147, Faustina was granted the title of augusta to cement her place in the imperial family.  When her father Antoninus died in 161, Marcus and his brother Lucius Aurelius Verus assumed the throne to reign jointly, and Faustina became an empress of Rome.  Faustina and Marcus had at least fourteen children together.  In the winter of 175, she died in Halala, which was renamed Faustinopolis in her honor.  Marcus Aurelius opened schools for orphan girls called Puellae Faustinianae (Girls of Faustina) in remembrance of her.  Faustina was also deified, with a temple dedicated to her and a statue of her put in the Temple of Venus in Rome.'},
  {label: 'Julia Domna', value: 'Julia Domna was born circa 160 AD to the high priest Bassainus at Emesa in Syria.  In 193 she became empress of the Roman Empire as the wife of Septimius Severus.  They had two sons, Caracalla and Geta, who ruled jointly with their father from 209-211.  When Septimius Severus died in 211, Caracalla and Geta created separate military factions, bringing the empire close to civil war.  Julia was forced to witness and helpless to prevent Geta’s assassination by Caracalla in 212.  Now the sole emperor, Caracalla would leave Julia in control of non-military aspects of the empire any time he left for battle.  He gave her the title “mother of the Senate and of the fatherland”.  She also became the first empress to be granted the title combination “Pia Felix Augusta”, which translates literally to pious happy empress, but may have served to indicate that she was more powerful than an average empress.  Julia is believed to have starved herself to death upon receiving news of Caracalla’s murder in 217, though some think she was ordered to do so by Macrinus, the new emperor.'},
  {label: 'Clodius Albinus', value: 'Decimus Clodius Albinus was born circa 150 AD in a province of Roman Africa that is now Tunisia.  He joined the military and made a name for himself, even being acknowledged by Emperor Marcus Aurelius for his actions and character during Avidus Cassius’s rebellion in 175.  Years later, when Emperor Pertinax was assassinated, people from different parts of the empire vied for the throne.  In the ensuing civil war, Albinus was at first allied with Septimius Severus.  He even added Septimius to his own name, becoming Decimus Clodius Septimius Albinus.  Severus named Albinus caesar and allowed him to rule over some Western portions of the empire while he established dominance elsewhere.  Other candidates for emperor were killed, and by 196 Severus began to want ultimate power.  He sent an assassin after Albinus, who narrowly escaped.  Severus then declared his son Caracalla his successor and had the Senate make Albinus an enemy of Rome.  In response, Albinus rallied his troops in Britannia and proclaimed himself emperor.  In 197, Albinus and Severus met in the Battle of Lugdunum (modern-day Lyons, France).  Albinus was killed, as was his family, and his supporters were harshly persecuted.'},
  // 3rd century CE
  {label: 'Julia Maesa', value: 'Julia Maesa was born in Emesa, Syria (modern-day Homs) sometime before 160 AD.  Her sister, Julia Domna, married then-senator Septimius Severus.  In 193, Severus became emperor and her sister became empress.  This prompted Maesa to move her husband and daughters, Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea, to Rome.  She and her family rose to political and financial prominence, both in Severus’s court and his son Caracalla’s.  However, Caracalla was murdered in 218 and the new emperor, Macrinus, ordered Maesa and her family to leave Rome.  Back in Emesa, she found others loyal to the Severan dynasty and plotted to challenge Macrinus.  She claimed that Soaemias’s son, Varius Avitus Bassianus (also known as Elagabalus), was actually the illegitimate son of Caracalla.  With help from others in Emesa and potentially Rome, the Emesan legion proclaimed Elagabalus the new emperor.  Other army divisions joined Elagabalus’s forces, likely because they were unhappy with their pay under Macrinus.  Macrinus and Elagabalus met in the Battle of Antioch in 218.  When some of Elagabalus’s troops began to retreat, Maesa and Soaemias joined the battle, rallying the troops and renewing their offensive.  Macrinus fled, but was captured and executed later, and Elagabalus became the new emperor.  Some people believe Maesa and Soaemias all but ran the empire themselves, but at the very least, the two women influenced the emperor.  When Elagabalus was assassinated in 222, her other daughter’s son, Severus Alexander, took the throne.  Again, Maesa held influence over the emperor, as did Julia Mamaea.  She died sometime between 224 and 227, leaving Mamaea to guide Severus Alexander by herself.'},
  {label: 'Maximinus (235–238 ce)', value: 'Maximinus I (c.173 - 238), also known as Maximinus Thrax as he was born in Thrace, was the first person to start as a soldier and rise through the ranks to become emperor.  He was likely a shepherd before he enlisted, and eventually commanded the Army of the Rhine.  When Severus Alexander, the emperor at the time, was murdered, the army proclaimed Maximinus the new emperor.  He spent most of his reign combating invaders along the Rhine and Danube rivers.  However, a rebellion in African regions of the empire and efforts by the Roman Senate to depose Maximinus caused the army to lose confidence in him.  While traveling with his forces through modern-day Italy in hopes of addressing the revolt in Africa, his troops murdered him, resulting in a period of chaos.  This chaos resulted in what is known as the year of the six emperors (Maximinus I, Gordian I, Gordian II, Balbinus, Pupienus, and Gordian III).'},
  {label: 'Gordian III (238–244 ce)', value: 'Gordian III was the youngest sole emperor of the united Roman Empire.  Born in 225 AD, he was the grandson of Gordian I and nephew of Gordian II, both of whom were ruling the empire together.  When his grandfather and uncle died in 238, the people and Praetorian Guard in Rome demanded Gordian III be recognized as heir, but the Roman Senate declared two senators, Pupienus and Balbinus, as new joint emperors.  The Praetorian Guard revolted, killing the senators and announcing Gordian III as the new emperor.  He was 13 at the time.  Throughout his rule, he had help from his family in commanding the government - first from his mother, then his father in law Timesitheus.  Gordian joined Timesitheus on a campaign against Persia in 242.  When Timesitheus died in 243, he was replaced by Philip the Arabian, who became the next emperor upon Giordian’s death in 244.  It is unclear how he died, with different sources claiming death in battle or murder by his own troops.'},
  {label: 'Philip II (247–249 ce)', value: 'Philip II was the son of Philip the Arabian.  In 244, when Philip was 7 years old, his father became emperor and appointed him caesar.  In 247, when he was just 10, his father made him co-emperor.  Philip died in 249 of unclear circumstances - some believe he was killed with his father in battle against Decius, who would become the next emperor, and others say he was killed by the Praetorian Guard upon receiving news of his father’s death.'},
  {label: 'Hostilian (251 ce)', value: 'Gaius Valens Hostilianus Messius Quintus, often referred to as Hostilianus or Hostilian, was one of Emperor Decius and Herennia Etruscilla’s sons.  His father designated him and his brother, Herennius Etruscus, caesars in 250.  In May 251, Etruscus became co-emperor, but both Decius and Etruscus were killed by the Goths in battle a month later.  Hostilianus acceded the throne in Rome, but the army proclaimed Trebonianus Gallus emperor.  The two men decided to rule together, likely to avoid another civil war.  After a few months, or as little as one month, Hostilianus died in unclear circumstances.  Some sources say he died of plague, while others suspect Gallus killed him.'},
  {label: 'Gallus (251–253 ce)', value: 'Gaius Vibius Trebonianus Gallus, often called Trebonianus Gallus or simply Gallus, was born circa 206 AD.  He held various political and military positions before Emperor Decius appointed him governor of the Moesia Superior province in 250.  Decius was killed in battle with the Goths in 251 along with his son and co-emperor, Herennius Etruscus.  This forced Gallus to make hasty peace with the Goths in a humbling treaty that allowed the Goths to keep everything they had plundered as long as they left the empire.  Meanwhile, Decius’s other son, Hostilianus, took the throne in Rome, but the army proclaimed Gallus the new emperor.  The two agreed to rule the empire jointly, but Hostilian died later that same year.  Some sources say he died of plague, while others suspect Gallus killed him.  Gallus then elevated his son Volusianus to co-emperor.  Like many emperors, Gallus faced revolts and invasions during his reign.  One such invasion was the Goths’ attempt to annex Lower Moesia, which was quelled by Aemilian, the current governor of Moesia Superior.  The army, who were dissatisfied with Gallus, named Amelian the new emperor.  Gallus called troops to aid him in the fight, commanded by future emperor Valerian, but they did not arrive in time.  Either in battle or by mutiny, Gallus and Volusianus were killed in 253.  When Valerian’s forces did arrive, Aemilian’s troops saw they were outnumbered and killed their leader, proclaiming Valerian the new emperor.'},
  {label: 'Valerian (253–260 ce)', value: 'Publius Licinius Valerianus, better known as Valerian, was an emperor of Rome from 253 to 260 AD.  He was a consul during Severus Alexander’s rule (222 to 235) and was instrumental in persuading the Senate to support Gordian I’s revolt against Maximinus.  Under Gallus’s rule (251 to 253) he commanded a military force on the Upper Rhine.  When Aemilian declared himself emperor 253, Valerian mobilized his army to reinforce Gallus’s in the conflict.  Gallus died before Valerian could reach him - in fact, some historians believe that Valerian didn’t start marching on Aemilian until after Gallus’s death to maximize Valerian’s  The threat of Valerian’s army caused Aemilian’s troops to mutiny.  Valerian was then declared the new emperor.  He named his son, Gallienus, joint emperor to rule the western part of the empire.  Valerian then traveled east to combat invasion by the Persians.  In June 260, he was taken captive in battle.  He was the first emperor this had happened to, and it gave rise to instability in the empire.  Valerian died in captivity, making Gallienus the sole emperor of Rome.'},
  {label: 'Gallienus (253–268 ce)', value: 'Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus, often simply called Gallienus, was born circa 218 AD into an affluent family.  His father, Valerian, became emperor in 253.  Valerian quickly made Gallienus co-emperor and divided the empire between the two of them - at the time, the empire was too large and faced too many threats for Valerian to handle alone.  Gallienus controlled the western portion and Valerian had the east.  Gallienus combated invaders and usurpers during his first few years as emperor.  In 260, Persian invaders captured Valerian, who died in prison.  This left Gallienus as the sole ruler, and he was not able to handle the whole empire by himself.  He lost territories in the east and west to invaders and revolts.  In 268, he drove the usurper Aureolus to retreat into Mediolanum (present-day Milan).  While laying siege to the city, he was assassinated.'},
  {label: 'Salonina', value: 'Publia Licinia Julia Cornelia Salonina was an augusta of the Roman Empire from 253 to 268 AD.  Hardly anything is known about Salonina’s origins.  She married Gallienus about 10 years before he became emperor in 253, ruling jointly with his father Valerian until 260, when Valerian died and Gallienus became sole emperor.  She and Gallienus had three children: Valerian II, Saloninus, and Marinianus.  In 268, Gallienus was murdered during the siege of Mediolanum (present-day Milan), but Salonina’s fate is unknown.  Some believe she was executed with some of her relatives at the command of the Roman Senate, but others believe she was spared.'},
  {label: 'Claudius II Gothicus (268–270 ce)', value: 'Marcus Aurelius Claudius, better known as Claudius II or Claudius Gothicus, was born in 214 AD.  He was a successful officer in the army under Gallienus, the emperor before him.  When Gallienus was killed in 268, Claudius’s troops proclaimed him emperor.  He inherited an empire besieged by invaders and disunity, during the heart of the Crisis of the Third Century.  The biggest threat was a Gothic invasion in the Balkans, which Claudius quickly addressed.  His defeat of a vast Gothic army at the Battle of Naissus earned him the surname “Gothicus,” meaning conqueror of the Goths, and made him a hero in Roman oral history.  He endeavored to reunify the empire, regions of which had split into the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires, but was unable to do so before he died of plague in 270.  He was immediately deified by the Roman Senate.  In the 4th century, decades after his death, a few allegations were made as to his family and ancestry.  One was that he was an illegitimate son of Gordian II, and another was that he was related to Constantius I and therefore part of the Constantinian Dynasty.  However, many historians doubt the validity of these claims.'},
  {label: 'Aurelian (270–275 ce)', value: 'Emperor Aurelian, born Lucius Domitius Aurelianus, rose to power at the height of the Crisis of the Third Century, when Rome was on the brink of collapse after repeated foreign invasions, civil wars, and imperial assassinations. He joined the Roman Army as a young man, and through military excellence alone, worked his way from the lowest economic class into command of Emperor Gallienus’ cavalry. Aurelian continued his rise through the military during Gallienus\' and Claudius\' reigns, until, at the time of Claudius’ death, Aurelian was so popular that he was able to challenge Quintillus for the title of Emperor. In just four years as Emperor, Aurelian expelled the enemies of Rome, fortified its borders, and reunified the Empire. He reconquered Gaul and Britain, dominated the Germanic tribes, and defeated many usurpers in the Eastern Empire. Aurelian was also known for popularizing the worship of Sol Invictus. He attempted to address Rome\'s disintegrating economy by reducing the cost of the Antoniniani, using only 5% silver, and producing them in huge quantities, but this only resulted in further hyperinflation. Combined with a limited grain import from Egyptian provinces, dissatisfaction with Aurelian grew, and he was murdered in Thrace while campaigning against the Sassanids.'},
  {label: 'Tacitus (275–276 ce)', value: 'The early life of Marcus Claudius Tacitus is shrouded in mystery, but it is known that he was most likely born to a wealthy Umbrian family. Over the course of his extraordinarily long life, he held the title of consul twice: once under Emperor Valerian, and once in 273 under the legendary Emperor Aurelian. By the time of Aurelian\'s assassination, Tacitus was extremely well respected, and held the venerable position of Princeps Senatus. His brief reign was notable only for cleaning up the mess left in Aurelian\'s absence: deifying his predecessor, executing his assassins, and restoring senatorial powers. Just before his death, Tacitus became known as Gothicus Maximus after his victory against Heruli (germanic) mercenaries that Aurelian had planned for his Eastern Campaign. Tacitus died of a fever in 276, but conflicting accounts claim that he was assassinated by military officials after putting his relatives into positions of power.'},
  {label: 'Florian (July–September 276 ce)', value: 'Like his half-brother Tacitus, little is known about the early life of Marcus Annius Florianus. He would likely have been forgotten by history if he had not been appointed praetorian prefect by his brother, the Emperor. After Tacitus’ death in June 276, Florian swiftly assumed the role of Emperor. He spent the entirety of his extremely brief reign combatting a revolt of the Syrian, Palestinian, Egyptian, and Phoenecian provinces, led by Marcus Aurelius Probus. Probus used the hot climate to his advantage, sapping the morale of Florian\'s troops, who eventually rose up against him and killed him.'},
  {label: 'Probus (276–282 ce)', value: 'Not much is known about the early life of Marcus Aurelius Probus, except that he came from a wealthy and powerful family. He is allegedly related to Emperor Claudius, and he joined the military upon reaching adulthood. He quickly gained accolades and established himself as a respected Lieutenant under Aurelian. As a result, Tacitus gave him an unprecedented amount of power as the supreme chief of the East, enabling him to secure the tumultuous border. He used this to his advantage in securing victory over Florian and becoming a popular Emperor. Probus used his military experience to force the Goths into a treaty with Rome. Afterward, he campaigned against the Germanic tribes of Gaul: subduing the Franks and rebuilding Hadrian\'s fortifications along the Rhine. Probus forced those he conquered to pay a tithe of manpower to his military, and established the precedent of allowing Germanic auxiliaries to settle in Rome. This fortified Rome\'s border on the west and restored agricultural practices. Afterward, he set his sights on Persia, but was assassinated while preparing his campaign.'},

  {label: 'Galerius (east, 305–311 ce)', value: 'Galerius Valerius Maximianus originally followed his father’s footsteps as a shepherd, but joined the army and distinguished himself as a soldier.  In 293, he was nominated as caesar by emperor Diocletian during the formation of the Tetrarchy.  He campaigned against various forces along the Danube and annexed territories in Persia in 299 after warring with their king, Narseh.  When Diocletian abdicated in 305, Galerius became emperor along with Constantius I, which meant two new caesars had to be designated.  Galerius chose Maximinus Daza (Maximinus II) and Valerius Severus (Severus II), who were easily influenced by him, as an attempt to expand his authority.  However, when Constantius died in 306, he and his army proclaimed his son Constantine (Constantine the Great) as emperor, rather than either of the caesars Galerius had appointed.  Galerius was furious, but hesitated to start a civil war.  His strategies to regain influence were not successful, partly due to many men declaring themselves emperor in different parts of the empire.  Galerius died of disease in 311.'},
  {label: 'Constantine I (306–337 ce; reunified the empire)', value: 'Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great, is best known for being the first Roman emperor to profess Christianity.  He was born sometime in the 280s AD to Helena, who was later canonized as a saint, and Constantius I, who became emperor in 305.  When Constantius died in 306, civil war broke out as Constantine, Macentius, and Licinius all declared themselves emperor.  During this conflict, he converted to Christianity, and by 324 he had emerged as the sole ruler of the empire.  Constantine attributed his success in life to his Christian faith.  He kickstarted the Roman Empire’s transition to a Christian state, putting a stop to the oppression of Christians in the empire and decriminalizing Christianity.  He also reformed the empire in non-religious respects, restructuring the government and the army.  The city of Byzantium was renamed Constantinople (now known as Istanbul) after he built an imperial residence there, and the city served as the capital of the empire for over a thousand years.  Despite his Christian faith, Constantine delayed his baptism until the end of his life.  He died in 337 and was buried in his church of the Apostles in Constantinople.  Many Eastern Christian denominations have venerated him as a saint.'},
  {label: 'Crispus', value: 'Flavius Julius Crispus was Constantine I’s eldest son, and the only son he had with Minervina.  He was born circa 300 AD and was named caesar in 317 along with his half-brother Constantine II and their cousin Licinius II (the latter named caesar as part of an agreement that ended a violent conflict between Constantine I and Licinius I).  Crispus ruled over Roman Gaul, and when his father and Licinius I warred again, Crispus’s forces defeated Licinius I’s navy.  This triumph, combined with a separate victory by Constantine I, forced Licinius and his son to step down, putting the empire completely under the dominion of the Constantinian dynasty.  In 326, for reasons unknown, Crispus died.  Many believe he was romantically involved with Fausta, his father’s second wife.  Some historians think that Constantine I discovered the affair and had them both executed, while others believe Crispus was exiled and committed suicide.'},
  {label: 'Galerius Valerius Maximinus (310–313 ce)', value: 'Galerius Valerius Maximinus Daza (or Daia), also known as Maximinus II, was a cattle herder before he joined the Roman army.  In 305 AD, emperor Diocletian abdicated the throne, and Maximinus’s uncle Galerius became emperor, ruling over the eastern part of the empire.  Galerius proclaimed Maximinus caesar shortly after taking the throne - however, in 308, he chose his friend Licinius over Maximinus to become emperor over the western part of the empire.  By this time, Maximinus had risen through the ranks of the army, and he angrily had his troops proclaim him emperor.  This title was not recognized by Galerius until 310.  A devoted pagan, he used his power to persecute Christians.  His non-Christian beliefs prompted priests in Roman-controlled Egypt to name him Pharaoh, in an attempt to combat the spread of Christianity there.  Maximinus was the last person granted the title of Pharaoh.  He died in 313, either by disease or suicide.'},
  {label: 'Licinius (308–324 ce)', value: 'Licinius was born into an Illyrian peasant family.  In 298, he accompanied his friend Galerius on a campaign against Persian forces.  When Galerius became emperor, he trusted Licinius with many things, including overseeing the eastern part of the empire while Galerius addressed the usurper Maxentius.  In 308, Galerius proclaimed Licinius a fellow emperor, giving him control over several provinces in the Balkans.  Unfortunately, Galerius’s death and an alliance between Maxentius and rival emperor Maximinus Daza (Maximinus II) caused Licinius unease.  He decided to pursue an alliance with Constantine I (the Great), the other emperor at the time, and married Constantine’s sister, Flavia Julia Constantia.  Licinius was able to defeat Daza in 313 when the latter attacked, but engaged in a more challenging civil war with Constantine I in 314.  Their conflict ebbed and flowed over ten years, until Licinius was soundly defeated in 324.  Flavia Julia Constantia was able to convince her brother to spare her husband’s life initially, but when Licinius’s conspiracy to regain control was revealed, Constantine had him hanged.'},
  {label: 'Constantine II (337–340 ce)', value: 'Constantine II was the oldest son of Constantine the Great and Fausta.  Born in 316, he was named caesar about a year later. His father had intended for him to rule the empire along with his brothers Constantius II and Constans, as well as their cousins Dalmatius and Hannibalianus.  However, Constantius ordered the murders of Dalmatius and Hannibalianus, as well as many other male relatives, shortly after Constantine the Great died.  Though Constantius is explicitly linked to these killings, there is evidence Constantine II and Constans conspired with him to assure their claims to the throne would not be challenged.  After becoming emperors in 337, the brothers divided the empire among themselves, with Constantine taking Gaul, Britannia, and Hispania.  However, he believed that as the eldest son, he deserved more.  This dissatisfaction led him to invade Italy in 340 to claim Constans’s territory.  Constans sent an army to combat Constantine’s forces, and Constantine was killed.  Constans then assumed control over Constantine’s territories.'},
  {label: 'Constantius II (337–361 ce)', value: 'Constantius II (Aug. 7, 317 - Nov. 3, 361) was the third son of Constantine the Great and Fausta.  Constantine had intended for Constantius to rule the empire along with his brothers Constantine II and Constans, as well as their cousins Dalmatius and Hannibalianus.  However, Constantius ordered the murders of Dalmatius and Hannibalianus, as well as many other male relatives, shortly after Constantine the Great died in 337.  So, at the age of 20, Constantius became a Roman emperor along with his two brothers.  The three of them divided the empire among themselves. Constantius II held dominion over the East, combating an invasion by Persian King Shapur II that included war elephants.  Meanwhile, in the West, Constans gained complete control in 340 when Constantine II died trying to invade his territory.  Ten years later, Constans was deposed and killed, and Magnentius declared himself emperor in the West.  Constantius refused to recognize Magnentius as the new emperor and launched a campaign against him.  The resulting civil war lasted three years.  Ultimately Constantius defeated Magnentius and became the sole ruler of the Roman Empire.  He attempted to use this power to mold the Christian church to his will, while also criminalizing paganism and Judaism.  He also repelled a number of Germanic invasions.  In 359, Shapur II resumed his attacks on the Roman Empire’s eastern borders, and Constantius returned there to challenge him.  However, a revolution in Gaul forced him to begin a journey back to the western region of the empire, during which he fell sick and did not survive.'},
  {label: 'Constans I (337–350 ce)', value: 'Constans I, born Flavius Julius Constans c. 323 AD, was the youngest son of Constantine I.  When his father died in 337, Constans and his brothers Constantius II and Constantine II declared themselves emperors and each took control of a different part of the empire.  Constans had Italy, Africa, and Illyricum, a province spanning the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea.  Three years into their joint rule, Constantine II invaded Italy, believing that as the oldest brother he had a right to Constans’s provinces.  When Constantine II was killed by Constans’s troops, Constans assumed control of both their territories (Spain, Gaul, and Britain), and consequently held dominion over the entire western portion of the empire.  He was the last legitimate emperor to set foot in Britain.  Surviving sources paint Constans as a deeply unpopular emperor, but they may have been influenced by mutinous propaganda.  He was overthrown and killed by forces loyal to Magnus Magnentius in 350, which sparked a civil war that ended with Constantius II as the sole emperor.'},
  {label: 'Decentius', value: 'Magnus Decentius was caesar under his brother Magnus Magnentius, who ruled the Western Roman Empire from 350 to 353 AD after overthrowing Constans.  Decentius was also appointed consul in 352.  When Gaul rebelled against Magnentius in 353, Decentius was exiled from Treves (now Trier), the capital of Magnentius’s portion of the empire.  He then unsuccessfully battled Germanic tribes invading Gaul.  He and his troops were under siege in Sens when he received news that Magnentius had committed suicide after being defeated by Constantius II.  This prompted him to take his own life, leading to the end of the civil war and Constantius II becoming the sole emperor of Rome.'},
